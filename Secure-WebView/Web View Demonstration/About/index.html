><h1>About</h1
><p
    >This application demonstrates a CSS-based mechanism to suppress some
    long-press interactions in embedded UIWebView and WKWebView controls.</p
><p
    >The project has two targets, one with BlackBerry Dynamics, one without.</p
><p
    >The BlackBerry Dynamics version implements low-level long-press
    interception, if an outbound Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) policy 
    applies. This results in different sharing options being displayed, and in
    protection being applied to data sent to the clipboard. The protection only 
    allows the data to be pasted into a BlackBerry Dynamics application that was 
    activated by the same end user against the same deployment.</p
><p
    >Both versions can demonstrate CSS-based long-press suppression. This is 
    controlled in the user interface on either of the other tabs. The inject 
    options activate the suppression, after which long-press interactions aren't 
    offered.</p
